# Cancer-Risk-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Excel

**Objective:**  
Developed an Excel dashboard to analyze cancer risk data for both males and females, aiming to provide a clear, visually engaging representation of cancer development and mortality risks.

**Description:**  
Using a Kaggle dataset, I created an Excel dashboard that offers:

- **Overview of Cancer Risks:** Displays general risk data for various cancers, highlighting development and mortality percentages through bar charts.
  
- **Gender Comparison:** Enables comparison of cancer risks between males and females, offering insights into gender-specific risk factors.

- **High-Risk Cancers:** Identifies cancers with the highest risks, facilitating a focused analysis of critical areas.

- **Cancer Type Analysis:** Breaks down risk data by cancer type, showing development and mortality ratios for each gender.

- **Top Mortality Rates:** Visualizes the top cancers with the highest mortality rates using clustered bar charts.

**Key Features:**
- **Pivot Tables:** Organized data to enhance dashboard interactivity.
- **Interactive Filters:** Added slicers for filtering data by cancer type.
- **Advanced Charting:** Utilized a variety of charts, including Combo (stacked area - clustered column), funnel, 100% stacked area, clustered bar, pie, doughnut, 3-D pie, stacked line, stacked column, and column charts for effective visual representation.

This project demonstrates my ability to utilize Excel's advanced features to create a user-friendly, insightful dashboard.
